# Description
I will not be showing how to run this app, this is more of a showcase of my work rather than anything else. This app used expo, react-native, react-redux, and plenty of other notable libraries. Many of the files and whole lines of code were removed for my safety. This is also not the main GitHub for this project, this is the public one for this project, I have another for this project that uses serverless (it's the Main API for this app).

I have left this project in pursuit of another project but this project shows my talents and what I can do in a couple of months.
